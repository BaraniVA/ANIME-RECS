Simple Anime Recommendation Project

This project is a simple anime recommendation system that uses content-based filtering.  

It makes use of the Anime recommendation database from Kaggle to gather data about different anime and uses this data to recommend anime to the user.

I have downloaded anime and user ratings from https://www.kaggle.com/CooperUnion/anime-recommendations-database .

Requirements:

Python 3

pandas

sklearn

Usage:

To run the project, simply clone the repository and run the anime_recommendation.py file. 

You will be prompted to enter the index of the anime you want recommendations for.

 The index of each anime is displayed when the data is loaded
 
Algorithm:

The recommendation algorithm used in this project is based on content-based filtering. 

It makes use of the cosine similarity method to compare the features of different anime and find the anime that are most similar to the anime selected by the user.

The following features are gathered for each anime:
